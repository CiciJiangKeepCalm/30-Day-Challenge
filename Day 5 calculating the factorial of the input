Loop your world (100 Marks)
For this challenge, you need to take an integer value as input from stdin, calculate its factorial and print the result to the stdout. 1

Input Format
A single integer value to be taken as input from stdin and stored it in a variable of your choice. 

Constraints
1 < = n < = 15

Output Format
Print the value which you will get after calculating the factorial of the input. 

Sample TestCase 1
Input
5
Output
120
Explanation
For a number, we will calculate its factorial by multiplying the number with the numbers which comes between 1(inclusive) and the number itself.
For input as 5, its factorial will be 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.
factorial of n (n!) = 1*2*3*4....n

       result=result*i;
